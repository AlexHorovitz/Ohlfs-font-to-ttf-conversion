# Ohlfs-font-to-ttf-conversion
Among the many UI accomplishments by Keith Ohlfs at NeXT is this wonderful little font. It has never been modernized to work on the current version of the OS and unfortunately Keith passed away unexpectedly (October 26th, 2016). Anyone who is willing to help in this effort is invited to join.
